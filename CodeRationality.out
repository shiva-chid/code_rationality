begin first computation
the first part of this code computes the action of G=PSp_4(F_3)
on M = H^2(X,Z) simeq Z^61. The explicit matrices x and y giving
this action are printed below
[Warning! matrices in Magma act on the right!]

The permutation representation Q[G/G40]=[Q]+[chi_24]+[V_15]
( 40, 8, 0, 13, 13, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 )
The permutation representation Q[G/G45]=[Q]+[chi_24]+[V_20]

The representation Q[G/G45] + Q[G/G40] - [chi_24]

In this third computation, for every H in G, compute
the Burnside Cokernel (if it is non-trivial) which is
R_Q(H) modulo permutation representations. Then determine
if V_H where V=[M tensor Q] is non-trivial in this group,
equivalently, determine if V_H is a virtual sum of permutation
representations of H. If not, then print a message
